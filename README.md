## 1. Project Description 
This experimental study aimed to develop a participatory mobile app to harvest real-time geo-tagged
observations during hurricane events. We designed our hurricane report application with AppStudio by 
customizing Quick Report template. The Quick Report template is a free-code solution for
creating citizen engagement apps that allow users to capture an observation and submit it to an online service.

## 2. Application Design
Cusomize ArcGIS QuickReport template in AppStudio
 
- Frontend: an interactive web page implemented with `HTML/CSS/JS/QML`
	* Visulize data with Model, Delegate, View framework 
	* Search educational Video in YouTube

- Backend: `ArcGIS`
	* Utilize map layer in ArcGIS online to manage data

## 3. Application Deployment
Atlantic hurricane season, which was the most active and the seventh costliest Atlantic hurricane
season on record. The observations were collected in the Courtland town on Virginia
on September 20, 2020, and in the Elkin town across the Yadkin River on North Carolina on October 29, 2020. 
The photos depicts the flooding, road closure and emerged facilities with precise
real time and geo-tagged location and attached short descriptions
